<H2>MATH2017 Real Analysis</H2>

<h3>Learning material for Chapter 2: Limits of functions and continuity</h3>

All 3 lectures covering Chapter 2 were cancelled due to industrial action. To make up for this, I recommend the following programme of study, to be completed before the next lecture (Thursday 16/2/23):

<ul>
<li>Watch the recorded online lecture from 2021 covering this material <a href="https://web.microsoftstream.com/video/a8ef94b6-beed-4faf-8ec5-e1d8dc098c69?search=math2017%20lecture%202">here</a>. Note that the theorem and example numbers have changed in the new version of the notes. To a first approximation, anything in the lecture labelled 1.x where x>25 is now labelled 2.(x-21).
<li>Work through the <a href="notes2.pdf">original notes with gaps</a>, trying your very best to fill in the gaps yourself.
<li>Check your work by consulting the <a href="notes2_no_gaps.pdf">completed notes</a>.
<li>Complete the <a href="https://cp1lump.github.io/mamnuuc/hadda/workshops/workshop2.pdf">workshop questions for week 3</a>. Solutions will be posted as usual.
</ul>
